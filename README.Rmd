Integrating external programs into a deployable, R workflow can be challenging. Although there are many useful functions and packages (e.g. `base::system()`) for calling code and software from alternative languages, these approaches require users to independently install dependant software and may not work across platforms. `outsider` aims to make this easier by allowing users to install, run and control programs *outside of R* across all operating systems.

It's like [whalebrew](https://github.com/whalebrew/whalebrew) but exclusively
for R.

**For more detailed information, check out the [`outsider` website](https://antonellilab.github.io/outsider/articles/outsider.html)**

## Installation

To install the development version of the package ...

```{r outsider-install, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
devtools::install_github('AntonelliLab/outsider')
```

Additionally, you will also need to install **Docker desktop**. To install
Docker visit the Docker website and follow the instructions for your operating
system: [Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

## Quick example

```{r example-setup, eval=TRUE, include=FALSE}
outsider::module_uninstall(repo = 'dombennett/om..hello.world')
```

```{r outsider-example}
library(outsider)
# outsider modules are hosted on GitHub and other code-sharing sites
# this repo is a demonstration outsider module
# it contains a function for printing 'Hello World!' in Ubuntu 18.04
repo <- 'dombennett/om..hello.world'
module_install(repo = repo, force = TRUE)
# look up the help files for the module
module_help(repo = repo)
# import the 'hello_world' function
hello_world <- module_import(fname = 'hello_world', repo = repo)
# run the imported function
hello_world()
```

## Available external programs

```{r, available, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  comment = ""
)
avlbl <- outsider::module_details(service = 'github')
prgms <- unique(avlbl[['program']])
prgms <- sort(prgms[prgms != ''])
time_date <- as.character(format(Sys.time(), '%H:%M %d %B %Y (%Z)'))
cat('Modules available on GitHub since ', crayon::bold(time_date), '\n\n')
for (prgm in prgms) {
  cli::cat_bullet(prgm, '\n')
}
```

For more details, see the [available modules table](https://antonellilab.github.io/outsider/articles/available.html)

## How does it work?

`outsider` makes use of the program [docker](https://www.docker.com/) which
allows users to create small, deployable machines, called Docker images.
The advantage of these images is that they can be run on any machine that has
Docker installed, regardless of operating system. The `outsider` package makes
external programs available in R by facilitating the interaction between Docker
and the R console through **outsider modules**. These modules consist of two
parts: a Dockerfile that describes the Docker image that contains the external
program and an R package for interacting with the Docker image. Upon installing
and running a module through `outsider`, a Docker image is launched and the R
code of the module is used to interact with the external program. Anyone can
create a module. They are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/) as well as
other code-sharing sites and can be searched for and downloaded through
`outsider`.
