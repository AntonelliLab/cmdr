#' outsider: Install and run programs, outside of R, inside of R
#'
#' The outsider package facilitates the installation and running of external
#' software by interfacing with docker (\url{https://www.docker.com/}).
#' External software are contained within mini-R-packages, called "outsider
#' modules" and can be installed directly to a user's computer through GitHub
#' (\url{https://github.com/}). The outsider package comes with a series of
#' functions for identifying and installing these outsider modules ("user"
#' functions). The package also comes with helper functions for
#' developing new outsider modules for hosting additional external programs
#' and software ("developer" functions).
