#' outsider: Install and run programs, outside of R, inside of R
#'
#' The outsider package facilitates the installation and running of external
#' software by interfacing with docker (\url{https://www.docker.com/}).
#' External software are contained within mini-R-packages, called "outsider
#' modules" and can be installed directly to a user's computer through online
#' code-sharing services such as GitHub (\url{https://github.com/}). The
#' outsider package comes with a series of functions for identifying,
#' installing and importing these outsider modules.
