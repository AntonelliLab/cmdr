Many data science, statistical and academic projects require running models on
external software and then performing subsequent analyses of the results in R 
e.g. for project specific testing and visualisation. `outsider` aims to make
this process simpler by first enabling non-R software to be run from within R
and, second, by making it easier to install external program.

## How it works

The `outsider` package acts as an interface between the R environment and
external programs that are hosted on virtual machines. A virtual machine is
hosted on a user's computer but acts like an external computer with its own
operating system. These virtual machines are run through the program [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). So long as a computer is running Docker,
then any of these virtual machines can be downloaded and run without any
installation process. Docker runs on multiple operating systems including
Windows, OSX and Linux.

For every external program provided through `outsider`, a virtual machine, or
"Docker image", needs to be described and specific R code -- for launching and
interacting with the program -- is required. This Docker image and R code are
provided through **outsider modules** that are hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/).

Users can install any of the available `outsider` modules. With two commands,
a user can install and import an external program for calling within R:
`module_install()` and `module_import()`.

## Installing `outsider`

Before you can make the most of `outsider` you will need to install and start
running Docker. Follow the installation instructions for your specific operating
system, ["Install Docker"](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

> For some operating systems, "Docker Desktop" is not available. If that is the
case, try ["Docker Toolbox"](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/). This is a
legacy Docker for older operating systems. It has similar functionality but
requires a virtual machine and has greater computational overhead.

With Docker installed, you then can install `outsider` via GitHub.

```{r install-outsider, eval=FALSE}
library(remotes)
install_remotes('ropensci/outsider')
```

### Non-R dependencies

* For Windows users you may need to install
[Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).
* For Mac users you may need to install and setup 
"Xcode command-line tools", by running the command `xcode-select --install` in
the terminal.

## Finding and installing modules

To see what modules are available you can see the "[available modules page](https://docs.ropensci.org/outsider/articles/available.html)".
Alternatively, for the latest available information you can search for modules
using the `module_details()` function.

``` {r module_details}
library(outsider)
# repo = NULL will search for ALL available modules
#  (this may take a long time, depends on internet connection and remote server)
print(module_details(repo = 'dombennett/om..mafft'))
```

To install a module, all that is required is to provide the repo name to the
function `module_install()`.

``` {r module_install}
library(outsider)
module_install(repo = 'dombennett/om..mafft', force = TRUE)
```

> **What is `repo`?** The `repo` is the unique name for a GitHub repository that
hosts an `outsider` module. It consists of two parts: a GitHub username and a
project name. Given its uniqueness, all modules are referred to by their `repo`.

To confirm the module is installed on a computer, it might be useful to use
`module_installed()`. This function returns a table of all installed modules.

``` {r module_installed}
library(outsider)
print(module_installed())
```

## Importing

All modules contain functions for interacting with the external program that
they host. To see these functions we can use `module_help()` to look up the help
documents.

``` {r module_help, eval = FALSE}
library(outsider)
# the whole module
module_help(repo = 'dombennett/om..mafft')
# specific function of a module (if known)
module_help(repo = 'dombennett/om..mafft', fname = 'mafft')
```

Once a function name is known of a particular module, the function can be
imported with `module_import()`.

``` {r module_import}
library(outsider)
mafft <- module_import(fname = 'mafft', repo = 'dombennett/om..mafft')
print(is(mafft))
```

> **What is `mafft`?** "mafft" is a multiple alignment tool for for biological
sequences. Note, a user can use *any* name they wish for the function when it
is imported. For example, `mafftymcmafftface <- module_import( ...` would work
equally well.

## Commands

The imported functions from modules act like portals to the external programs
the modules host. To run a command, a user needs to use the function name and
give arguments corresponding to the arguments of the external program. For
example, on command-line to list the help information for `mafft`, we would
write `mafft --help`. With `outsider` we can do run `mafft('--help')`.

For a more complicated example, we could launch a small analysis with `mafft`
like so.

``` {r command_analysis, eval = FALSE}
library(outsider)
mafft <- module_import(fname = 'mafft', repo = 'dombennett/om..mafft')
mafft(arglist = c('--auto', 'input_sequences.fasta', '>',
                  'output_alignment.fasta'))
```

>**Why the spaces between arguments?** All the arguments of the external,
command-line program must be provided as separated characters. This helps
`outsider` parse the elements.

### How does that last line work?

```
mafft(arglist = c('--auto', 'input_sequences.fasta', '>',
'output_alignment.fasta'))
```
describes in R how to call the MAFFT program via command-line/terminal. It is
equivalent to `mafft --auto input_sequences.fasta > output_alignment.fasta` if
we were to call the program via command-line/terminal. How do we know how to
structure the program arguments? In the case of MAFFT we can look-up the
arguments on their website, [mafft.cbrc.jp](mafft.cbrc.jp/). But often for
command-line programs we can call for help with `-h` or `--help`. For MAFFT at
the command-line, we could run `mafft --help` or with `outsider` we can run:

```{r mafft-help}
mafft(arglist = '--help')
```

The help page returned tells us how to structure the arguments:

```
[options] [input_file] > [output_file]
```

Where the options (e.g. alignment method, number of threads) are always
indicated first with `--` and the input and output files are indicated second
with the `>`.

## Uninstalling

Clean up your computer by removing unwanted modules with `module_uninstall()`.

```{r uninstall}
library(outsider)
module_uninstall(repo = 'dombennett/om..mafft')
```

## Building your own module

Unfortunately, `outsider`'s utility is limited by the number of available
modules. Fortunately, it is very easy to create and upload your own module.
The package comes with a range of helper functions for minimising the amount of
coding for a module developer. If you know how to install an external program on
your own computer which you would like  would like to run it through `outsider`
and you have some experience with GitHub, then explore the
["outsider.devtools"](https://github.com/ropensci/outsider.devtools)
package.
