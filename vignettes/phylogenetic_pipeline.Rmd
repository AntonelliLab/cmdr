```

The whole point of `outsider` is to bring lots of programs together into a
single place to allow the development of analysis pipelines. Let's demonstrate
this process by creating a simple pipeline for constructing an evolutionary
tree. We will generate a tree in three steps: obtain orthologous DNA sequences,
align these sequences and then estimate a tree.

In our example, we will keep it simple and fast and generate a tree of
[CytB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_b) sequences in the primate
genus of Night Monkeys, **Aotus**.

# phylotaR

To get us started we need DNA sequences that represent the same gene region,
i.e. sequences that are orthologous. We can obtain our sequences quickly using
the example data from the R package
[`phylotaR`](https://github.com/ropensci/phylotaR).

`phylotaR` provides a pipeline for identifying orthologous sequences from a
reputable online biological sequence database. The package comes with a few
pre-calculated example sequences. We can extract sequence clusters that
represent the gene region [cytb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_b)
with the following script.

```{r prephylotar}
aotus <- NULL
```
```{r phylotar}
library(phylotaR)
# Example data
data("aotus")
# Generate summary of identified clusters
smmry <- summary(aotus)
# Extract cluster with 'cytb' in feature name
cytb <- smmry$ID[which(grepl('cytb', smmry$Feature))[1]]
cytb <- drop_clstrs(aotus, cytb)
# Reduce cluster to just one sequence per taxon
cytb <- drop_by_rank(cytb, n = 1)
# Get taxonomic IDs for taxa in cluster
txids <- get_txids(cytb, cid = cytb@cids[[1]])
# Convert IDs to species names
sp_nms <- get_tx_slot(cytb, txids, slt_nm = 'scnm')
sp_nms <- sub(' ', '_', sp_nms)
# Write out
write_sqs(cytb, 'aotus_cytb.fasta', sq_nm = sp_nms, sid = names(sp_nms))
# What do the first 50 lines of the file look like?
cat(paste0(readLines('aotus_cytb.fasta', n = 50), collapse = '\n'))
cat('...')
```

# Alignment

Now we have written our sequences to a text-based `.fasta` file, we need to
align them! To do this, we can use
[`mafft`](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/). We first need to install
the module and then import the key function, `mafft`. After doing this, we can
call the `mafft` program using the same arguments that we would if it were
calling the program via command-line. In our case we can simple run our
alignment using the '--auto' parameter.

```{r mafft}
library(outsider)
# Install module
repo <- 'dombennett/om..mafft'
module_install(repo = repo, force = TRUE)
# Import the function
mafft <- module_import(fname = 'mafft', repo = repo)
# Run our program with normal mafft arguments
# Note: all arguments must be separate character variables.
mafft(arglist = c('--auto', 'aotus_cytb.fasta', '>', 'alignment.fasta'))
```

# Phylogeny

We can repeat the same process as we did for `mafft` but instead for
[`RAxML`](https://github.com/stamatak/standard-RAxML) -- a command-line program
for estimating evolutionary trees from an alignment of DNA sequences using a
model of molecular evolution (GTRGAMMA) with maximum likelihood.

```{r raxml}
library(outsider)
# Install
repo <- 'dombennett/om..raxml'
module_install(repo = repo, force = TRUE)
# Import
raxml <- module_import(fname = 'raxml', repo = repo)
# Run
raxml(arglist = c('-m', 'GTRGAMMA', '-s', 'alignment.fasta', '-p', '1234',
                  '-n', 'aotus_cytb', '-T', '2'))
```

# Visualisation

Now, let's check out our tree! We can use the R package
["Analsis of Phylogenetics and Evolution" or `ape`](http://ape-package.ird.fr/)
to do this.

```{r visualise}
library(ape)
tree <- read.tree('RAxML_bestTree.aotus_cytb')
plot(tree)
```

```{r cleanup, include = FALSE}
files_to_remove <- c(list.files(pattern = c('.fasta')),
                     list.files(pattern = 'RAxML_'))
for (file_to_remove in files_to_remove) {
  try(file.remove(file_to_remove), silent = TRUE)
}
repos <- c('dombennett/om..raxml', 'dombennett/om..mafft')
for (repo in repos) {
  try(module_uninstall(repo), silent = TRUE)
}
```
